# std-qsort-person.c

A simple proof of concept of the usage of structs and files, written in the C language.

## Algorithm

- read entries at `data/in.csv`
- parse them into a `struct` called `person`
- sort them by height ascending
- write sorted entries to `data/out.csv`

## How to run it

```bash
make
build/app
```
